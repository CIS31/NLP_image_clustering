 "Harmonious blend of warm colors"

This category fits well with the description of the dominant color scheme as a "harmonious blend of colors" that creates a visually appealing contrast. The presence of warm colors such as the golden tone of the egg, bright orange and green hues of the vegetables, and earthy tones from the black seaweed also supports this classification.' at fine level.
